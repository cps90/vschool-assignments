  <div class=main-article-header>UTA president to leave agency after new legislation eliminates position</div>
  <div class=main-aritcle-body>SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Transit Authority board has voted to terminate President and CEO Jerry Benson because new legislation eliminates his position. SB136, signed by Gov. Gary Herbert on March 22, eliminates the president, CEO and general manager UTA positions, according to an emailed statement from UTA spokesman Carl Arky. Benson will be terminated as of May 7, as SB136 goes into effect on May 8, according to Arky. UTA will have no authority to employ someone in those positions after the bill goes into effect, Arky said. Benson’s termination is not due to cause, he added. “The board is doing what it feels best to open the door for new leadership to take this great agency forward,” UTA Board of Trustees Chairman Greg Bell said in the statement. “I want to emphasize the board has the highest regard and respect for Jerry Benson.” Benson said he was confident that the agency would be in good hands following his departure. “I’m confident new leaders with new vision will take UTA through the upcoming period of change,” he said. “As I move on, I know UTA is prepared to move forward as well.” Benson took over as UTA president and CEO in 2016, according to Arky. Before that, Benson served as UTA’s vice president of operations, chief operating officer, chief performance officer, director of communications and director of human resources, Arky said. He has had more than 30 years of public transportation experience.
